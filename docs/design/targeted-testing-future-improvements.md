# Targeted Property Testing: Future Improvements

This document outlines potential improvements and extensions to the targeted property testing implementation in Hedgehog, based on comparison with PROPER and identified enhancement opportunities.

## High Priority Improvements

### 1. Auto-generated Neighborhood Functions

**Current State**: Manual implementation required for each type
```rust
// Currently required for custom types
impl NeighborhoodFunction<User> for UserNeighborhood {
    fn neighbor(&self, input: &User, temperature: f64, rng: &mut dyn RngCore) -> Option<User> {
        // Manual implementation required
    }
}
```

**Proposed**: Derive macro for automatic generation
```rust
#[derive(Generate, NeighborhoodFunction)]
struct User {
    #[neighborhood(range = 10)]
    age: u32,
    #[neighborhood(alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")]
    name: String,
    #[neighborhood(probability = 0.3)]
    active: bool,
    #[neighborhood(element_change_rate = 0.2)]
    tags: Vec<String>,
}

// Auto-generates:
// impl NeighborhoodFunction<User> for UserNeighborhoodFunction
```

**Benefits**:
- Reduces boilerplate code significantly
- Matches PROPER's automatic neighborhood generation capability
- Allows fine-grained control through attributes
- Maintains type safety and compile-time verification

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Extend `hedgehog-derive` crate with `NeighborhoodFunction` derive macro
- Support attribute-based configuration for each field
- Generate composite neighborhood functions that modify individual fields
- Handle nested structures and collections automatically

### 2. Extended Type Coverage

**Current Built-in Support**: `i32`, `f64`, `Vec<T>`, `String`

**Proposed Extensions**:

```rust
// Temporal types
impl NeighborhoodFunction<std::time::Duration> for DurationNeighborhood {
    // Add/subtract time with temperature scaling
}

impl NeighborhoodFunction<chrono::DateTime<Utc>> for DateTimeNeighborhood {
    // Adjust time within reasonable bounds
}

// Network types  
impl NeighborhoodFunction<std::net::IpAddr> for IpAddrNeighborhood {
    // Modify IP addresses within subnet ranges
}

// File system types
impl NeighborhoodFunction<std::path::PathBuf> for PathNeighborhood {
    // Modify path components, extensions, etc.
}

// Collection types
impl NeighborhoodFunction<std::collections::HashMap<K, V>> for HashMapNeighborhood<K, V> {
    // Add/remove/modify key-value pairs
}

impl NeighborhoodFunction<std::collections::BTreeSet<T>> for BTreeSetNeighborhood<T> {
    // Add/remove elements, maintaining ordering
}

// Option and Result types
impl NeighborhoodFunction<Option<T>> for OptionNeighborhood<T> {
    // Switch between Some/None, modify inner value
}

impl NeighborhoodFunction<Result<T, E>> for ResultNeighborhood<T, E> {
    // Switch between Ok/Err, modify inner values
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Broader applicability to real-world data types
- Enables targeted testing for domain-specific applications
- Reduces need for custom neighborhood function implementations

### 3. Shrinking Integration

**Current State**: Targeted results use regular shrinking from original generators

**Proposed**: Targeted-aware shrinking that preserves search insights
```rust
impl TargetedResult {
    /// Shrink targeted results while preserving utility information
    pub fn shrink_targeted<T>(&self, input: &T, neighborhood: &dyn NeighborhoodFunction<T>) -> Vec<(T, TargetedResult)> {
        // Generate shrunk candidates using neighborhood function
        // Evaluate utility for each shrunk candidate
        // Return candidates with preserved utility information
    }
}

pub struct TargetedShrinkStats {
    pub original_utility: f64,
    pub shrunk_utility: f64,
    pub shrink_steps: usize,
    pub utility_preserved: bool,
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Better minimal counterexample finding for targeted tests
- Preserves utility information during shrinking process
- Enables analysis of how utility changes during shrinking

## Medium Priority Improvements

### 4. Multiple Search Strategies

**Current State**: Only simulated annealing implemented

**Proposed**: Additional search strategies
```rust
pub enum SearchStrategy {
    SimulatedAnnealing(SimulatedAnnealingConfig),
    HillClimbing(HillClimbingConfig),
    TabuSearch(TabuSearchConfig),
    GeneticAlgorithm(GeneticAlgorithmConfig),
}

pub struct HillClimbingConfig {
    pub max_steps: usize,
    pub plateau_tolerance: usize,
}

pub struct TabuSearchConfig {
    pub max_steps: usize,
    pub tabu_list_size: usize,
    pub aspiration_criteria: AspirationCriteria,
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Different strategies work better for different problem types
- Enables comparative analysis of search strategies
- Provides fallback options when SA doesn't converge well

### 5. Multi-objective Optimization

**Current State**: Single utility function optimization

**Proposed**: Pareto-optimal solution finding
```rust
pub struct MultiObjectiveConfig {
    pub objectives: Vec<Box<dyn Fn(&T, &TargetedResult) -> f64>>,
    pub weights: Option<Vec<f64>>,
    pub pareto_analysis: bool,
}

pub struct MultiObjectiveResult {
    pub solutions: Vec<T>,
    pub pareto_front: Vec<(T, Vec<f64>)>,
    pub dominance_info: DominanceAnalysis,
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Handle complex optimization problems with multiple conflicting objectives
- Find trade-off solutions in realistic scenarios
- Enable analysis of objective conflicts

### 6. Adaptive Temperature Scheduling

**Current State**: Fixed exponential cooling schedule

**Proposed**: Adaptive scheduling based on search progress
```rust
pub enum TemperatureSchedule {
    Exponential { cooling_rate: f64 },
    Linear { initial: f64, final: f64 },
    Adaptive { acceptance_target: f64, adjustment_rate: f64 },
    Custom(Box<dyn Fn(f64, usize, f64) -> f64>),
}

pub struct AdaptiveScheduler {
    target_acceptance_rate: f64,
    adjustment_factor: f64,
    history_window: usize,
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Better convergence properties for different problem types
- Automatic tuning based on search behavior
- Reduced need for manual parameter tuning

## Low Priority Enhancements

### 7. Parallel Search

**Current State**: Single-threaded search

**Proposed**: Parallel search with multiple starting points
```rust
pub struct ParallelTargetedConfig {
    pub num_threads: usize,
    pub coordination_strategy: CoordinationStrategy,
    pub result_aggregation: AggregationStrategy,
}

pub enum CoordinationStrategy {
    Independent,
    SharedBest,
    PopulationBased,
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Faster convergence through parallel exploration
- Better global optimum finding
- Utilization of multi-core systems

### 8. Search Space Analysis

**Current State**: No analysis of search space properties

**Proposed**: Automated search space characterization
```rust
pub struct SearchSpaceAnalysis {
    pub landscape_roughness: f64,
    pub local_optima_estimate: usize,
    pub gradient_information: Option<GradientStats>,
    pub recommended_strategy: SearchStrategy,
}

pub fn analyze_search_space<T>(
    generator: Gen<T>,
    utility_function: impl Fn(&T) -> f64,
    sample_size: usize,
) -> SearchSpaceAnalysis {
    // Sample search space and analyze properties
    // Recommend optimal search strategy and parameters
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Automatic strategy selection based on problem characteristics
- Better parameter tuning guidance
- Insights into problem difficulty and search behavior

### 9. Integration with External Optimizers

**Current State**: Only built-in search strategies

**Proposed**: Integration with external optimization libraries
```rust
pub trait ExternalOptimizer {
    type Config;
    fn optimize<T>(&self, config: Self::Config) -> TargetedResult;
}

// Integration with scientific optimization libraries
impl ExternalOptimizer for ScipyOptimizer {
    // Bridge to Python scipy.optimize
}

impl ExternalOptimizer for NLoptOptimizer {
    // Integration with NLopt library
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Leverage mature optimization algorithms
- Access to specialized algorithms for specific problem types
- Comparative analysis against established baselines

### 10. Performance Benchmarking Suite

**Current State**: Examples demonstrate effectiveness but no systematic benchmarking

**Proposed**: Comprehensive benchmarking framework
```rust
pub struct BenchmarkSuite {
    pub test_functions: Vec<BenchmarkFunction>,
    pub strategies: Vec<SearchStrategy>,
    pub metrics: Vec<PerformanceMetric>,
}

pub struct BenchmarkResults {
    pub convergence_rates: HashMap<String, f64>,
    pub solution_quality: HashMap<String, f64>,
    pub computational_cost: HashMap<String, Duration>,
    pub statistical_significance: SignificanceTest,
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Systematic comparison with random generation
- Performance regression detection
- Strategy recommendation based on empirical data

## Breaking Changes Considerations

Most improvements can be implemented as additive features without breaking existing APIs:

- New neighborhood functions are trait implementations
- Additional search strategies extend existing enum
- Enhanced statistics are additive fields
- Configuration options use builder pattern with backwards compatibility

The only potential breaking change would be if we significantly redesign the core `TargetedResult` type, but this can be avoided through careful API evolution.

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: Number of types with auto-generated neighborhood functions
- **Performance**: Improvement in convergence speed and solution quality
- **Coverage**: Percentage of common Rust types supported out-of-the-box
- **Usability**: Reduction in boilerplate code required for targeted testing
- **Effectiveness**: Comparative analysis showing superior performance vs random generation

These improvements would establish Hedgehog's targeted property testing as the most comprehensive and user-friendly implementation available in any property-based testing framework.
